# Stock-Prices
My first C++ project that declares 3 variables: totAmPaid, totAmSold, and totAmLost. The variables totAmPaid, and totAmSold are given specific values which help determine totAmLost. Then totAmLost is displayed.
1.	Get Info for: # shares, original stock price, new stock price.
2.	Declare “totAmPaid”
3.	Declare  “totAmSold”
4.	Declare “totAmLost”
5.	Calculate the total amount paid: 
totAmPaid = 600 / 21.77
6.	Calculate the total amount sold:
totAmSold = 600 / 16.44
7.	Calculate the total amount lost:
totAmLost = totAmPaid – totAmSold
8.	Display: totAmLost
